## To install LyX styles:

1. copy PhDThesisPSnPDF.cls to the appropriate LaTeX folder, e.g. under linux, copy it to: /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex
2. run "sudo texhash" from the command line
3. copy PhDThesisPSnPDF.layout to the appropriate LyX folder, e.g. under linux, copy it to: /usr/share/lyx/layouts
